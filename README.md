# Collins-Span-Ling-Thesis

Thank you for taking a look at my honors thesis in Spanish. This project focuses on adverb placement in Spanish and how it relates to 
- verb movement
- semantic classification of adverbs
- syntactic effects of adverbs
- syntactic and semantic interface of adverbs
- adverb morphology
- second language acquisition

This project would not be possible without the help of [Dr. Becky Gonzalez](https://spanish-portuguese.uiowa.edu/people/becky-gonzalez), the [multilingual syntax lab](https://multilingualsyntax.lab.uiowa.edu/people), [Dr. Zuzanna Fuchs](https://www.zuzannazfuchs.com/), [Dr. Christine Shea](https://christineshea.weebly.com/), and the participants who generously completed the tasks to supply data.

The raw data is not presented here due to maintain confidentiality of participants. Some processed data is available in the statistics models, but much of it is not present. Please refer to the thesis for all the data.
